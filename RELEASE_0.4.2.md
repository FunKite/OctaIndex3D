## üì¶ Installation

### From Crates.io

```toml
[dependencies]
octaindex3d = "0.4"

# With recommended features (default includes parallel + simd)
octaindex3d = { version = "0.4", default-features = true }

# With optional features
octaindex3d = { version = "0.4", features = ["hilbert", "container_v2", "gis_geojson"] }
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FunKite/OctaIndex3D
cd octaindex3d
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo build --release
```

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Three ID Types**: Galactic128 (global), Index64 (Morton), Route64 (local routing)
- **High Performance**: Cross-platform optimizations (Apple Silicon, AMD, Intel)
- **14-Neighbor Connectivity**: More isotropic than cubic grids (6 neighbors)
- **Space-Filling Curves**: Morton and Hilbert encoding for spatial locality
- **Hierarchical Refinement**: 8:1 parent-child relationships across resolutions
- **Bech32m Encoding**: Human-readable IDs with checksums
- **Compression**: LZ4 (default) and optional Zstd support
- **Streaming Container Format**: Append-friendly compressed spatial data storage
- **GeoJSON Export**: WGS84 coordinate export for GIS integration

---

## üîß Feature Flags

### Performance Features (Enabled by Default)
- **`parallel`** - Multi-threaded batch operations with Rayon
- **`simd`** - SIMD-accelerated operations (BMI2, AVX2, NEON)
- **`serde`** - Serialization support

### Optional Features
- **`hilbert`** - Hilbert64 space-filling curve (better locality than Morton)
- **`container_v2`** - Streaming container format with checkpoints
- **`gis_geojson`** - GeoJSON export with WGS84 coordinates
- **`zstd`** - Zstd compression (in addition to LZ4)

### GPU Features (Not Recommended)
- **`gpu-metal`**, **`gpu-vulkan`**, **`gpu-cuda`** - CPU is 10x faster

---

## üîÑ Migration from v0.3.x

v0.4.2 is fully backward compatible with v0.3.x. No API changes required.

Simply update your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
octaindex3d = "0.4"
```

All performance improvements are automatic!

## üéØ Performance Tips

### Compiler Flags (Recommended)

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo build --release
```

Enables:
- **Apple Silicon:** NEON instructions, Firestorm/Icestorm optimizations
- **AMD:** BMI2, AVX2, Zen 3+ tuning
- **Intel:** BMI2, AVX2, architecture-specific tuning

### Batch Size Recommendations

- **Small (<100):** Default API, optimized for prefetching
- **Medium (100-50K):** Batch operations, cache-blocked processing
- **Large (>50K):** Parallel processing automatically engaged
