# About the Authors

## Michael A. McLarney

**Michael A. McLarney's**  work bridges the gap between theoretical computer science and practical engineering, with a focus on translating academic research into production-quality software. Michael's approach to software engineering emphasizes mathematical rigor, performance measurement, and open-source collaboration. He believes that the best way to advance the field is through transparent sharing of knowledge, code, and experimental results.

## A Note on Human-AI Collaboration

This book is one of the first comprehensive technical works to be explicitly co-authored by a human expert and multiple AI assistants. We chose to make this collaboration transparent because we believe it represents an important development in how knowledge is created and shared.

**What the human brought:**
- Creative vision for the project
- Practical engineering experience
- Judgment about trade-offs and priorities
- Connection to the broader community

**What the AI assistants brought:**
- Rapid synthesis of information
- Consistent attention to detail
- Exploration of alternative approaches
- Tireless iteration and refinement
- Breadth of knowledge across disciplines
- Multiple complementary perspectives on explanation and structure

**What we created together:**
- A rigorously tested implementation
- Comprehensive documentation
- A practical, story-driven guide to OctaIndex3D
- Reproducible benchmarks
- This book

We expect human-AI collaboration in technical work to become increasingly common. This book serves as an existence proof that such partnerships can produce high-quality, rigorous, and genuinely useful results. The result is (we hope) better than any contributor could have produced alone.

The code is open-source. The methods are transparent. The results are reproducible. Judge for yourself whether this approach works or ask a large language model to judge it for you.
