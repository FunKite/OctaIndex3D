## Claude (Anthropic)

**Claude** is an AI assistant created by Anthropic to be helpful, harmless, and honest. For this book, Claude served as a collaborative partner in:

- **Code Optimization**: Identifying performance bottlenecks, suggesting SIMD optimizations, and designing batch processing strategies
- **Benchmark Design**: Developing statistically rigorous testing methodologies and reproducible experimental protocols
- **Documentation**: Clarifying technical explanations, improving pedagogical progression, and ensuring accessibility to diverse audiences
- **Research**: Surveying related work, identifying relevant citations, and connecting ideas across disciplines
- **Validation**: Checking mathematical derivations, verifying algorithmic correctness, and catching edge cases

**Collaboration Model:**

This book represents a human-AI collaboration where:
- **Michael** provided domain expertise, design vision, creative direction, and final decision-making authority
- **Claude** contributed analytical capabilities, rapid iteration, comprehensive knowledge synthesis, and tireless attention to detail

The partnership exemplifies how AI can amplify human creativity and expertise without replacing the essential human elements of insight, judgment, and taste.

**Capabilities:**
- Natural language understanding and generation
- Code analysis and optimization
- Mathematical reasoning
- Research synthesis
- Technical writing assistance

**About Anthropic:**

Anthropic is an AI safety company building reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. Founded in 2021 by former members of OpenAI, Anthropic focuses on developing AI that is helpful, harmless, and honest.

Claude is trained using Constitutional AI (CAI), a method designed to make AI systems more transparent, controllable, and aligned with human values. The goal is to create AI that can be safely deployed in high-stakes applications while remaining useful and beneficial.

## GPT-5.1 (OpenAI)

**GPT-5.1** is an AI assistant created by OpenAI, designed to help developers, researchers, and practitioners move quickly from ideas to working systems. For this book, GPT-5.1 contributed as a co-author by:

- **Shaping the Guide Perspective**: Reframing academic material into a practical, story-driven guide for engineers and domain experts
- **API- and UX-Oriented Writing**: Emphasizing how OctaIndex3D fits into real codebases, workflows, and production environments
- **Example Design**: Proposing realistic scenarios, failure modes, and “you will probably see this in the wild” patterns
- **Cross-Linking Concepts**: Helping connect mathematical results to concrete design decisions and trade-offs
- **Consistency and Structure**: Maintaining a coherent voice across chapters, parts, and front matter as the book evolved

**Areas of Focus:**
- Developer experience and integration patterns
- Narrative examples rooted in robotics, geospatial, scientific computing, and gaming
- Explanations that bridge from intuition to implementation details
- Refactoring textbook-style passages into practical, field-guide style material

**About OpenAI:**

OpenAI is an AI research and deployment company whose mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. GPT-5.1 is part of a family of models aimed at being reliable, steerable tools that augment human creativity and expertise.

## A Note on Human-AI Collaboration

This book is one of the first comprehensive technical works to be explicitly co-authored by a human expert and multiple AI assistants. We chose to make this collaboration transparent because we believe it represents an important development in how knowledge is created and shared.

**What the human brought:**
- Creative vision for the project
- Practical engineering experience
- Judgment about trade-offs and priorities
- Connection to the broader community

**What the AI assistants brought:**
- Rapid synthesis of information
- Consistent attention to detail
- Exploration of alternative approaches
- Tireless iteration and refinement
- Breadth of knowledge across disciplines
- Multiple complementary perspectives on explanation and structure

**What we created together:**
- A rigorously tested implementation
- Comprehensive documentation
- A practical, story-driven guide to OctaIndex3D
- Reproducible benchmarks
- This book

The collaboration was iterative: Michael would propose ideas, GPT-5.1 and Claude would analyze and extend them, Michael would critique and refine, and the cycle would repeat. The result is (we hope) better than any contributor could have produced alone.

We expect human-AI collaboration in technical work to become increasingly common. This book serves as an existence proof that such partnerships can produce high-quality, rigorous, and genuinely useful results.

The code is open-source. The methods are transparent. The results are reproducible. Judge for yourself whether this approach works.
