# Errata

This file tracks known issues in the OctaIndex3D book after publication of draft versions. The goal is to make it easy for readers to verify whether a problem they notice is already recorded, and to see the planned fix.

To report a new issue, please open a GitHub issue in the main repository and tag it with `book-errata`, or submit a pull request that updates this file.

## How Entries Are Organized

Each erratum should include:

- **Location**: Chapter, section, and approximate line or paragraph
- **Edition / Commit**: Book version or Git commit hash
- **Issue**: What is wrong (typo, unclear wording, incorrect formula, outdated API, etc.)
- **Correction**: The intended text or behavior
- **Status**: `pending`, `fixed-in-draft`, or `released`

Example entry:

> **Location**: Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1, definition of $\mathcal{L}_{BCC}$  
> **Edition / Commit**: Draft v0.1.0 (commit `abcd1234`)  
> **Issue**: Missing parity condition in informal description  
> **Correction**: Clarify that $(x + y + z)$ must be even  
> **Status**: fixed-in-draft
