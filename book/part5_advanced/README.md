# Part V: Advanced Topics

## Overview

Part V explores advanced topics that build on the foundations laid in earlier parts. These chapters are more speculative and research-oriented, aimed at readers who want to push OctaIndex3D and BCC-based indexing into new territory.

The focus here is on:

- Scaling to distributed and parallel systems.
- Integrating with modern machine learning workflows.
- Outlining open research problems and future directions.
