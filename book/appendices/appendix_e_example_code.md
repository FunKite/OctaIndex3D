# Appendix E: Example Code

This appendix gathers self-contained examples that illustrate how to:

- Initialize a frame registry and define custom frames  
- Construct identifiers from coordinates and vice versa  
- Build and query containers for common workloads  
- Integrate OctaIndex3D with external systems (e.g., GIS, ML frameworks)  

Each example references relevant chapters for deeper explanation.
