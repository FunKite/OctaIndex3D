# Appendix H: Integration Examples

This appendix collects **end‑to‑end integration sketches** that pair OctaIndex3D with other tools and ecosystems.

The focus is on showing how OctaIndex3D fits into real projects rather than exploring every API in depth.

---

## H.1 Rust Ecosystem Integration

Planned examples include:

- Using `nalgebra` for transforms and camera models
- Bridging `ndarray` volumes into BCC‑indexed containers
- Combining OctaIndex3D with async runtimes for streaming ingestion

---

## H.2 Geospatial Tools

Planned examples include:

- Exporting BCC data to GeoJSON and visualizing in QGIS
- Converting between WGS84 coordinates and BCC identifiers
- Integrating with GDAL‑based pipelines

---

## H.3 Game Engines and Simulation Frameworks

Planned examples include:

- Wiring OctaIndex3D into Bevy or Godot for voxel worlds
- Using BCC‑based LOD in physics or AI subsystems
- Exchanging data with existing octree or grid systems
