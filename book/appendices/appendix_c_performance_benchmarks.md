# Appendix C: Performance Benchmarks

This appendix summarizes benchmark methodology and representative results.

It documents:

- Hardware and software configurations used for testing  
- Workload definitions (data distributions, operation mixes)  
- Comparative results between BCC-based and cubic-grid approaches  

The goal is to make performance claims in the main text transparent and reproducible.
