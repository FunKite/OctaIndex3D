# Appendix A: Mathematical Proofs

This appendix collects extended proofs and derivations supporting results from Part I. It is organized by topic rather than by chapter, so that related arguments appear together.

The goal is to:

- Provide complete, rigorous proofs for interested readers.
- Keep the main text focused on intuition and applications.

Sections include:

- A.1 Voronoi Cell Characterization  
- A.2 Sampling Efficiency Derivation  
- A.3 Isotropy Coefficient Calculation  
- A.4 Space-Filling Curve Locality Bounds
