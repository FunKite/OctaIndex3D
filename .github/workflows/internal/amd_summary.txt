Key Insights
------------

1. AMD EXCELS AT MORTON OPERATIONS
   - BMI2 hardware PDEP/PEXT instructions
   - 505M decode ops/sec (3.22x faster than Apple's LUT!)
   - Sustained 3.6 GHz clock helps single-threaded performance
   - Best choice for Morton-heavy workloads

2. LARGE BATCH CACHE ISSUE (FIXABLE!)
   - 10K routes: Only 6.5M/s (vs 37.8M Intel, 50.3M Apple)
   - Root cause: 64MB L3 too small + Rayon overhead
   - Potential fix: Increase chunk size, better cache blocking
   - Expected improvement: 6.5M ‚Üí 40M routes/sec (6x gain possible)

3. BEST COST/PERFORMANCE RATIO
   - AWS c6a.xlarge: ~$0.154/hr (AMD)
   - AWS c7i.xlarge: ~$0.17/hr (Intel)
   - 10% cheaper with better single-threaded performance
   - Best choice for most cloud deployments

4. CLOCK SPEED ADVANTAGE
   - AMD: Fixed 3.6 GHz (sustained)
   - Intel: Variable 3.2-3.6 GHz (turbo boost)
   - Apple: ~3.2 GHz (P-cores)
   - Consistency matters for latency-sensitive workloads

5. BMI2 IS A ZEN 3+ FEATURE
   - Zen 1/2: Slow BMI2 (microcode emulation)
   - Zen 3+: Fast BMI2 (dedicated silicon)
   - This EPYC 7R13 is Zen 3 ‚Üí BMI2 is fast!

Recommendations
---------------

CHOOSE AMD EPYC WHEN:
  ‚úÖ Cost-sensitive cloud deployment (best value)
  ‚úÖ Morton operations are primary workload
  ‚úÖ Latency-sensitive single-threaded operations
  ‚úÖ Small-medium batches (<10K elements)
  ‚úÖ Want consistent fixed clock speed

CHOOSE INTEL XEON WHEN:
  ‚úÖ Processing very large batches (>50K elements)
  ‚úÖ Workload benefits from 105MB+ cache
  ‚úÖ Need DDR5 memory bandwidth
  ‚úÖ Future AVX-512 optimization planned

CHOOSE APPLE M2 WHEN:
  ‚úÖ macOS development/deployment
  ‚úÖ Medium-large batches (1K-50K elements)
  ‚úÖ Energy efficiency critical
  ‚úÖ Want unified memory architecture

GPU Testing Results ‚ùå
----------------------

NVIDIA L4 GPU was tested and found to be SLOWER than CPU:

Performance Comparison:
  - 1K routes:   CPU 47.7M/s vs GPU ~5M/s   (CPU 9.5x faster!)
  - 10K routes:  CPU 6.5M/s  vs GPU ~4M/s   (CPU 1.6x faster)
  - 100K routes: CPU ~40M/s  vs GPU ~15M/s  (CPU 2.7x faster)

Why GPU Failed:
  1. PCIe transfer overhead (5-10 Œºs) >> operation time (20 ns)
  2. GPU launch latency cannot be amortized
  3. CPU cache locality beats GPU global memory
  4. Operations are too fast for GPU to be beneficial

Conclusion: GPU acceleration is NOT recommended for OctaIndex3D
  - Adds complexity (CUDA licensing, cudarc dependency)
  - Zero performance benefit (actually slower!)
  - Would need >1M routes per batch to potentially break even
  - CPU-only instances are cheaper AND faster

Future Optimization Opportunities
----------------------------------

1. FIX LARGE BATCH PERFORMANCE (HIGH PRIORITY!)
   Current: 6.5M routes/sec on 10K batches
   Target:  40M routes/sec (match Intel's cache efficiency)

   Approaches:
   - Increase Rayon chunk size: 2048 ‚Üí 4096+
   - Tune BLOCK_SIZE for 64MB L3 cache
   - Raise parallel threshold: 50K ‚Üí 100K
   - NUMA-aware memory allocation

   Expected: 6x improvement (from profiling data)

2. Cache Hierarchy Optimization
   - 64MB L3 is good but needs careful blocking
   - Optimize for AMD's CCX layout (8 cores per CCX)
   - Better prefetching for Zen 3 architecture

3. AVX2 Improvements
   - AMD has excellent AVX2 (better than some Intel chips)
   - More aggressive vectorization possible
   - Fused Multiply-Add (FMA) not fully utilized

4. Zen 4/5 Optimization
   - Newer EPYC (9xx4, 97x4) have AVX-512
   - Could match Intel's AVX-512 potential
   - Worth targeting if users upgrade
